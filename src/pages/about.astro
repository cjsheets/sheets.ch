Hello!
My name is Chad.

I'm a software developer who works at Microsoft. I build solutions for Educators.

About Me
Originally from Ohio, I currently live in the Seattle area. I studied Electrical Engineering and have a diverse professional background.

I'm a husband and a father who likes frontend development, music, and coffee.

Further elaboration about me (in all its boring detail) is available on LinkedIn

About sheets.ch
I enjoy learning and contributing to open source projects. This site is a convenient place to collect notes for my future, forgetful self.

I also thought it would be neat ot own Swiss property in the form of this TLD. For only $15/year, I get to be available at sheets.ch/ad :-)
